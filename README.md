# Cool calculator in my vulkan engine
code is very messy and completely not production ready this version of engine had a very bad cordinate system so yeah i do not recommend to anyone to use it

### Required things to build
- Vulkan SDK (self explanatory)
- xxd (for generating .h files for assets)
- python3 (any version will work i promise. it is used for gererating build scripts and assets.h)
- llvm-strip (yup sometimes reduces size)
- clang (g++ what is that?)
- upx (used to reduce exe size even more)
- fun
- optimism

if you want to build it simply run `sh build-release.sh`
## BBBUt i dont have `sh` im Binbows user
BAHAHAAHh you are lying my friend you have git installed on your computer right? if so open its files go into bin directory and there you have it ready to use sh.
